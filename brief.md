# LBG Assessment Day - Task

As part of their new suite of digital products, Lloyds Bank are launching a new visualisation tool to aid customers with their long-term financial planning. Customers will be able to see a representation of the predicted performance of their existing products but also the effects of switching to a different account type or adding a new account. The estimates need to be as personalised as possible, factoring in a customerâ€™s previous behaviour. 

Your team will be responsible for designing a prototype of this application according to the provided list of requirements. You need to define the Minimum Viable Product for your prototype with justification for why features were or were not included. You should also produce some wireframes to show an outline of your app. You will have 4 hours to work on this. 

## Group Organisation

You will be assigned to a group of 3-4 people. You should decide among yourselves how to split the work.

At some point each member of the group will leave the call to attend an interview. It is your responsibility to manage your time and inform your team when you need to leave for an interview.

When asking for help please **do not** use your cohort's Slack channel. If you need help at any point you should leave your breakout room to ask a trainer for help. You will not be observed while working on the task, but a member of the BNTA team will drop into the room periodically to see how you're getting on.

## Presentations

Your presentations should include: 

- Wireframe(s) for the application 
- Acceptance criteria for the MVP 
- Highlight any challenges you anticipate 


Your presentation should be a maximum of 7 minutes long. There will be 3 minutes after each presentation for questions from the audience. We want to hear from every member of the group during the presentations. 

Presentations will be assessed by the LBG interview panel and members of the BNTA team present on the day.
