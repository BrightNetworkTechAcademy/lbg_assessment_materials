# LBG Assessment Day - User Requirements

This document lists some of the user requirements gathered by the UX team for this product. Not everything on this list would be expected to form part of the MVP, and it is not an exhaustive list.

A user should be able to:

- See the current value of every account they hold with the bank 
- See the outstanding balance on any credit card/loan they hold with the bank 
- See the value of their combined portfolio 
- Modify any of those values to simulate making a deposit, withdrawal, or payment 
- See the predicted values of their products after an arbitrary period 
- See a graphical representation of the performance of each of their products over that period 
- See a graphical representation of the performance of their combined portfolio over that period 
- See a graphical representation of the performance of a given product relative to others in the portfolio 
- Simulate adding additional products to their portfolio 
- Simulate switching/upgrading products 
- See recommendations for products which may be suitable for them 
- Compare the predicted performance of two products 
- Include noteworthy events in the predicted performance, e.g. Making a deposit on a house after reaching a savings goal 
- Factor regular occurrences into predicted performance, e.g. Annual holidays 
- Analyse previous spending habits and factor results into predicted performance
